# Proxy

This script utilizes the [axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios) and [cheerio](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cheerio) libraries to select a random proxy from a proxy list and make a request to a specified URL. This README file provides information on how to use and run the script.

## Requirements

- Node.js
- npm (Node Package Manager)

## Installation

1. Clone the project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MuhammetSonmez/proxyClient.git
```

Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd proxyClient
```
Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

## example output
```
  Connection successful.
  Working proxy information:
  IP Address: 123.456.789.10
  Port: 8080
  If this IP is the same: 123.456.789.10 --> proxy is working :)
```
